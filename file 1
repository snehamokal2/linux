my second repositary
The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration.
Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business.
Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.
